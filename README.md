# AudioBooks

This is a project to practise VIPER Architecture and test in Swift.

The main idea of the app is show the AudioBooks from LibriVox.org, Search, add to favourites and download the tracks. I'm using the LibriVox.org API, to get audioBooks information.

Still in progress. I will develop more whenever I can.
